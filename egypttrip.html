<h1>Up and Down the Nile</h1>

<h4>During our time in Egypt we traveled from Alexandria, which sits along the
    Mediterranean, down to Cairo. In Cairo we got to see the pyramids and the
    old Egyptian museam.

<h4>After Cairo we flew down to Aswan and started on a cruise down the Nile. 
    Along the cruise we saw multiple temples and cities. The temple of Horus is 
    in the picture below, and was the largest temple front that we saw. The largest 
    known temple is Karnak in Luxor.

<h4>Luxor was the last stop on the cruise and there we visited the Valley of the Kings
    and got to ride in a hot air balloon during the sunrise. The picture below is in
    King Tuts tomb and below that are pictures from the hot air balloon ride.
