        <p class="about">
        Over my time at USNA I have had multiple opportunities to 
        experience parts of the fleet and travel around the world.
        Sophomore year I was able to go on a submarine cruise out
        of Bangor Washington. 
        Junior year I was worked as a weapons instructor over plebe
        summer, and then travel to Egypt for two weeks. More pictures 
        from the trip to Egypt can be found

        Senior year I went on
        an aviation cruise and then worked plebe summer with the 
        class of '25.

        fun, and overall experience, they would rank as follows:
