MVC - Architecture
The html is the view of the content.
The controller is in charge of what veiw is being presneted.
server is all about producing veiws or html files
We can create these page dynamics to display veiws however we want 
we will be producing .rb or .py - controller functions
the controller function returns the code that produces the veiw
The last part of the architecture is the model
We will need a database that holds all of the information
that we may want to sell on the e-commerce sheet - essentially
an excel sheet.
We will need to program objects (models)
